# Physics Simulations

A collection of interactive physics simulations for education, created by Mr. B. Leung.

## Structure

The simulations are organized by topic:

*   **Heat and Gases**: Thermodynamics, convection, specific heat capacity.
*   **Optics and Wave Motion**: Light reflection, refraction, diffraction.
*   **Force and Motion**: (Coming soon)
*   **Electricity and Magnetism**: (Coming soon)
*   **Nuclear Physics**: (Coming soon)
*   **Biology**: Ecosystems and osmosis.
